# Zombie-Shooting
A OpenGL C++ Zombie Shooting Game

Zombie Shooting is a shooting game made with OpenGL in C++ languange. It has a game engine like framework which can be easily used to
make other games. It is purely based on OpenGL 1.1 currently and uses SOIL library for loading images. Hope it will give some idea
about how to make games with basic OpenGL in C++.
